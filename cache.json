          "description": "Sometimes I take down videos from my channel. It's normally for a combination of reasons, but what it really waters down to is that I don't think those videos leave an accurate impression to new viewers. Here's a list of reasons I may want to take down a video:\nIt's incredibly poorly-made/There's some giant error\nIt doesn't fit the the general \"theme\" or tone of my channel\nIt seems backwards and harmful in hindsight\nEvery time I take down a video, I instantly upload it to my backup channel, DenshiBackup (YouTube link). This is because while I don't want to make my videos lost media! I'm sure that basically no one cares much for any of my videos, especially my older ones, but they have sentimental value to me (yes, even the garbage ones) so I keep them there for myself and anyone else who i‚Ä¶",

In this article, I will list and summarize the most common British qualifications, alongside some editorial paragraphs giving my opinion on each one.\n(I)GCSE\nLength: 2-3 years\nGrades: U-9 (U-A**)\nYears: 9-10/11\nSummary\nThe (International) General Certificate of Secondary Education is a qualification standard introduced in the UK in 1988. (The \"International\" GCSE is essentially the same system, but with some content cut for international audiences.) The (I)GCSE has a set of core subjects which are mandatory to complete; one of these is Humanities, for which you can pick between History or Geography. Alongside this, ‚Ä¶",

This is appended automatically by the script everytime I publish a new article, and it works on RSS as well! This way, people have a convenient way of contacting me about any article; The link also sets the subject of your email to the title of my article, for extra comfiness.\nOne minor addition is that I fixed the links in the RSS feed. Now my articles link directly to their blog page counterparts, and not to the very unhelpful rolling blog page. I hope this makes reading my articles more convenient for all.\nI am considering getting rid of the rolling blog page in future, or maybe adding some extra features. If you have any suggestions, click the \"Reply-to\" link and send me an email with your ideas!\n(Reply-to)",
