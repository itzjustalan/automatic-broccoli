                    <span>Sometimes I take down videos from my channel. It&#x27;s normally for a combination of reasons, but what it really waters down to is that I don&#x27;t think those videos leave an accurate impression to new viewers. Here&#x27;s a list of reasons I may want to take down a video:
It&#x27;s incredibly poorly-made/There&#x27;s some giant error
It doesn&#x27;t fit the the general &quot;theme&quot; or tone of my channel
It seems backwards and harmful in hindsight
Every time I take down a video, I instantly upload it to my backup channel, DenshiBackup (YouTube link). This is because while I don&#x27;t want to make my videos lost media! I&#x27;m sure that basically no one cares much for any of my videos, especially my older ones, but they have sentimental value to me (yes, even the garbage ones) so I keep them there for myself and anyone else who i‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working the last few weeks on some additions to my self-hosting cabal of software; I&#x27;m happy to present these changes in today&#x27;s post.
XMPP Server!
This is old news, but I have an XMPP server! (denshi.org) I&#x27;m there and, in addition to having some public multi-user chats, these chats are bridged over to the Matrix and Discord thanks to Matterbridge. Here are the chats:
Generalic Chat, the classic, no-topic discussion channel,
Tech Support, an excellent (terrible) place to ask for help with computers,
and finally, Bloated Meme Chat, where all the spiciest memes üå∂Ô∏è üå∂Ô∏è are posted.
The XMPP server is open to registrations, so if you&#x27;ve been meaning to try out XMPP, here&#x27;s your chance to get an account through in-band registration. Just make sure to encrypt your messages, or I&#x27;ll sp‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Whenever I talk to my younger siblings and their friends about their future in school, I often see a lot of confusion regarding the current educational and examination systems. In this article, I will list and summarize the most common British qualifications, alongside some editorial paragraphs giving my opinion on each one.
(I)GCSE
Length: 2-3 years
Grades: U-9 (U-A**)
Years: 9-10/11
Summary
The (International) General Certificate of Secondary Education is a qualification standard introduced in the UK in 1988. (The &quot;International&quot; GCSE is essentially the same system, but with some content cut for international audiences.) The (I)GCSE has a set of core subjects which are mandatory to complete; one of these is Humanities, for which you can pick between History or Geography. Alongside this, ‚Ä¶</span>
